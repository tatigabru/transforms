A Python library for preprocessing and augmentation of biological signals. 

- The library works with signals in a list and np.array format.
- Comprises a comprehensive, diverse range of signal transformations.
- Based on numpy, scipy and open sourced libruaries.
- Supports mutli-channel signals.
- Provides tutorials and vizualisations.
- Supports for `Python 3.7` and higher.
- Easy integration with PyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras.
